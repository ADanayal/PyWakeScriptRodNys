# PyWake Script to model

Scripts for a Dissertation report looking, focusing the optmisation of Offshore wind farms, evalauting the effects of internal and external wake propagation on performance, and implementing a possible mitigation strategy to reduce these effects.

The script entitled Main defines the key components used to evaluate internal and external wake effects along the RÃ¸dsand 2 and Nysted offshore wind farms using a range of engineering wake models. It contains the final model configurations and enables the use of the simulation_results function to generate desired outputs, wether a single value or a full plot.

The script makes use of the PyWake open library, the documentation of which can be found at https://topfarm.pages.windenergy.dtu.dk/PyWake/
In order to effectively use the script, another file included, which needs to be used in order to import the correct engineering Wake models
